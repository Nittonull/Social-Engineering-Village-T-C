About:- Cold Calls at Seaside Conference 
**Dive into Social Engineering with a Real-World Challenge!**

Cold Calls at Seaside bring a fresh, interactive way to experience social engineering for all skill levels. This non-competitive activity allows attendees to step into the world of "vishing" (phone-based social engineering) and test their abilities in a fun, hands-on setting.

### What Are Cold Calls?  

**How It Works:**  
- After signing up, you’ll be assigned a random company to call, complete with a provided phone number and contact.
- You’ll receive **three surprise objectives**: one easy, one medium, and one hard, which focus on obtaining specific information from the call.
- Step into the SEV phone booth and give it your best shot—you’ll have **five minutes** to complete as many objectives as possible!

**Why "Cold Calls?"**  
- Inspired by the sales term, “cold calls” mean the recipient isn’t expecting you.
- Unlike our Vishing Competition, Cold Calls require no prep time—no research or planning, just pure, in-the-moment skill.

**Cost:**  
- It’s completely **free** and accessible to all Seaside attendees on a **first-come, first-serve basis**.

**No Competition, No Pressure:**  
- There are no winners or losers in Cold Calls—this is all about experimenting and gaining confidence with vishing tactics in a relaxed environment.

**How to Sign Up:**  
- **On-site sign-up** is available with SEV Volunteers or Staff during Seaside.
- Upon registration, you’ll be asked to follow SEV's ethical guidelines and agree to a code of conduct.
